I worked with Emily Flanagan.

- The file song.scrape.R scrapes our song lyric data. The results of scraping are stored as RData objects to save time in reproducing (the scraping takes a few minutes to run)

- The file Final_Clean_Code.R contains the final results for the actual results included in the poster, which is only a subset of the models that we actually tried.

- The file report.Rmd walks through additional models that we fit. Most of them were unsuccesful, and thus did not get included in the poster. But this code is included in case someone wants to reproduce our claims that "Latent Semantic Analysis didn't improve that much" or "Using only sentiment words did not improve the result"
